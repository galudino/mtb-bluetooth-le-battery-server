# Bluetooth&reg; LE Battery Server with OTA update (C++ Implementation)

This repository is a **C++ rewrite** of Infineon's [mtb-example-btstack-freertos-battery-server](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-btstack-freertos-battery-server) code example. It demonstrates the implementation of a simple Bluetooth&reg; Battery Service with over-the-air (OTA) update capability, but with a modernized C++ architecture.

The Battery Service exposes the battery level of the device and supports OTA updates over a Bluetooth&reg; Low Energy connection. A peer app on Windows can be used to push OTA updates to the device. The app downloads and writes the image to the secondary slot. On the next reboot, MCUboot copies the new image over to the primary slot and runs the application. If the new image is not validated in runtime, on the next reboot, MCUboot reverts to the previously validated image.

The OTA update feature is enabled by the [anycloud-ota](https://github.com/Infineon/anycloud-ota) middleware repository on GitHub.

## What's Different About This Repository

This repository is a modernized **C++ rewrite** of the original Infineon example. Key differences include:

### C++ Architecture

-   **Modern C++ (C++17)**: The codebase uses modern C++ features including classes, templates, `constexpr`, `noexcept`, and type-safe enums (`enum class`)
-   **Object-Oriented Design**: Core functionality is encapsulated in classes:
    -   `ble_context` - Manages Bluetooth LE stack, connections, advertising state, and OTA operations
    -   `led_pwm<T>` - Template-based LED controller using PWM signal implementations
    -   `pwm_signal<T>` - CRTP-based platform-agnostic PWM abstraction with Cypress HAL implementation
-   **Modular Header Organization**: Clean separation of concerns across `src/bluetooth/`, `src/led/`, `src/tasks/`, `src/transport/`, and `src/utilities/`
-   **Type Safety**: Extensive use of `enum class` for state management and compile-time checks via `static_assert`

### MCUboot as a Submodule

-   MCUboot is included as a **git submodule** in `third-party/mcuboot/` - no separate cloning required
-   You must clone this repository with submodules (see [Getting Started](#getting-started))

### VSCode Integration

-   Pre-configured VSCode tasks for building and programming
-   Includes `setup-vscode.sh` script to configure the workspace automatically

---

## Building and programming MCUboot

MCUboot is included as a submodule in `third-party/mcuboot/`. This is a dual-core project where the MCUboot bootloader app runs on the CM0+ core and the OTA update app runs on the CM4 core.

You must first build and program the MCUboot bootloader project into the CM0+ core; this needs to be done only once. The OTA update app can then be programmed into the CM4 core.

Perform the following steps to build and program the MCUboot bootloader:

1. The bootloader and this application must have the same understanding of the memory layout. The information is contained inside flashmaps. Check this application's Makefile for the `OTA_FLASH_MAP` variable to find out the flashmap being used.

    Copy the flashmap present in _<mtb_shared>/ota-update/release-vX.X.X/configs/flashmap_ to the _third-party/mcuboot/boot/cypress/_ folder.

2. Open a CLI terminal and navigate to the `third-party/mcuboot/boot/cypress` folder.

3. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

4. Build the MCUboot application:

    ```bash
    make clean app APP_NAME=MCUBootApp PLATFORM=PSOC_062_2M FLASH_MAP=./psoc62_2m_int_swap_single.json
    ```

    Make sure that `PLATFORM` and `FLASH_MAP` variables are mapped correctly for your target kit.

5. After building, open the _MCUBootApp.hex_ file using [CYPRESS&trade; Programmer](https://softwaretools.infineon.com/tools/com.ifx.tb.tool.cypressprogrammer):

    **Figure 2. CYPRESS&trade; Programmer with HEX file image**

    ![](images/cypress_programmer.png)

6. After programming, the bootloader starts automatically. Confirm that the UART terminal displays:

    **Figure 3. Booting with no bootable image**

    ![](images/booting_without_bootable_image.png)

---

## Operation

### Battery Service

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Use your favorite serial terminal application and connect to the KitProg3 COM port. Configure the terminal application:

    Baud rate: 115200 bps; Data: 8 bits; Parity: None; Stop: 1 bit; Flow control: None; New line for receive data: Line Feed(LF) or Auto setting

3. Program the board using one of the following:

    <details><summary><b>Using VSCode Tasks</b></summary>

    1. Open VSCode's Command Palette (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`)
    2. Select **Tasks: Run Task**
    3. Select **Program Debug** or **Program Release**
     </details>

    <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

    From the terminal, execute the `make program` command:

    ```bash
    make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
    ```

    </details>

After programming, the application starts automatically. Observe the messages on the UART terminal.

#### **Test using the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect mobile app**

1. Turn ON Bluetooth&reg; on your Android or iOS device.

2. Launch the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app.

3. Press the reset switch on the kit to start Bluetooth&reg; LE advertisements. The red LED (LED1) starts blinking to indicate that advertising has started. Advertising will stop after 120 seconds if a connection has not been established.

4. Swipe down on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen to start scanning for Bluetooth&reg; LE peripherals; your device appears on the AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app home screen. Select your device to establish a Bluetooth&reg; LE connection (see Figure 4). Once the connection is established, the user LED turns to 'always ON' state.

    **Figure 4. AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect app device discovery**

    ![](images/figure2.png)

5. Select the Battery Service (see Figure 5) from the carousel view to check the battery levels. Tap **START NOTIFY** to get notifications of the changing battery levels:

    **Figure 5. AIROC&trade; Bluetooth&reg; Connect Battery Service tab**

    ![](images/figure3.png)

    **Figure 6. Battery level**

    ![](images/figure4.png)

6. A notification is issued every 1 second, and the value is reduced by 2.

7. Use the KitProg3 COM port to view the Bluetooth&reg; stack and application trace messages in the terminal window. Note the application version.

    **Figure 7. Log messages on KitProg3 COM port**

    ![](images/figure5.png)

### OTA Update service

The app also supports OTA updates over Bluetooth&reg; LE. A peer app is used to push an updated image to the device. It can be downloaded from the [OTA peer apps repo](https://github.com/Infineon/btsdk-peer-apps-ota). This example uses the Windows app for pushing an OTA update image.

For preparing the OTA update image:

1. Modify the source code as desired (e.g., change the `BATTERY_LEVEL_CHANGE` define to change the battery drain rate)

2. Update the app version number in the Makefile by changing `OTA_APP_VERSION_MAJOR`, `MINOR VERSION`, and `OTA_APP_VERSION_BUILD`

3. Build the app, but **DO NOT PROGRAM**. This version will be used to push via the peer Windows app (_WsOtaUpgrade.exe_).

4. In the project directory, navigate to _build/\<TARGET>/\<Config>_ and locate the _.bin_ file. Copy this file to the same directory as _WsOtaUpgrade.exe_.

5. Open the terminal and navigate to _WsOtaUpgrade.exe_. Initiate the update:

    ```
    ./WsOtaUpgrade.exe <App_name>.bin
    ```

6. Select your device and click **OK**, then click **Start** to begin the OTA update.

    **Figure 8. WsOtaUpgrade app**

    ![](images/figure6.png)

    **Figure 9. WsOtaUpgrade app start**

    ![](images/figure7.png)

    Monitor the progress via the progress bar or device terminal.

    **Figure 10. WsOtaUpgrade progress bar**

    ![](images/figure8.png)

    **Figure 11. Download progress display on the terminal**

    ![](images/figure9.png)

    Once the download is completed, the device will reboot. MCUboot either copies the new image over to the primary slot or swaps the images based on the flashmap used.

    **Figure 12. MCUboot reboot on download finish**

    ![](images/figure10.png)

7. Observe the terminal for upgrade logs. Notice the updated app version once the app is launched by MCUboot.

    **Figure 13. Updated app with faster rate of change of battery level**

    ![](images/figure11.png)

### Revert OTA update image

To test the revert feature of MCUboot, create and send a 'bad' image as an OTA update. The bad image does not call `cy_ota_storage_validated()`; instead it prints a banner message and issues a soft reset. Upon reboot, MCUboot reverts to the previously validated image.

1. Edit the Makefile and add `TEST_REVERT` to the `Defines` variable:

    ```
    DEFINES+=CY_RETARGET_IO_CONVERT_LF_TO_CRLF CY_RTOS_AWARE TEST_REVERT
    ```

2. Update the app version in the Makefile. Build the app, but **DO NOT PROGRAM**.

3. Use _WsOtaUpgrade.exe_ to push the OTA update image to the device.

4. After reset, MCUboot will update to the new image. After the update, a banner is printed and a soft reset is issued. MCUboot then reverts to the 'good' image.

    **Figure 14. MCUboot reverting the image**

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.

<details><summary><b>In VSCode</b></summary>

After running `./setup-vscode.sh`, use the provided launch configuration:

1. Open the Run and Debug panel (`Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + D`)
2. Select the appropriate debug configuration
3. Press F5 to start debugging

</details>

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

The code example has two main services:

-   **Bluetooth&reg; LE GATT Server for Battery Service**

    Battery Service simulates the battery level, which changes continuously from 100 to 0 percent in steps defined by the `BATTERY_LEVEL_CHANGE` macro. It has a default value of 2 percent. On a periodic timer, notifications are sent to the client.

    In the C++ implementation, this is handled by:

    -   `battery_service_task` - FreeRTOS task that updates and sends battery level notifications
    -   `ble_context` - Manages BLE connections and GATT operations

-   **OTA Firmware Upgrade Service**

    The OTA Firmware Upgrade Service enables updating the application image remotely. A peer app on Windows can be used to push an OTA update to the device.

    The `ble_context` class manages OTA operations through:

    -   `ota_agent_initialize()` - Initialize and start the OTA agent
    -   `ota_agent_write_handler()` - Handle GATT write requests for OTA operations
    -   `ota_agent_confirmation_handler()` - Handle OTA operation completion

    **Figure 15. OTA image transfer sequence**
